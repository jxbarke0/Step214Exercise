# Step214Exercise


The final project of the C# course had us choose between one of four types of applications to create. I chose to create a simple web application that would allow an Excel file to be imported into a database. I wanted to learn how to get the three applications (Visual Studio, SQL Server, and Excel) to interact seamlessly. In my view, an application is useless unless it can interact with other applications in some meaningful way. A program that is isolated quickly becomes obsolete.
